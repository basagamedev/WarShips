# WarShips
This project, titled "Naval Battle," was developed over four-day period, primarily intended for submission as part of a job application evaluation process. 

The game, which falls into the naval battle genre, has been meticulously designed to showcase a wide range of programming design patterns and principles.

# Game Description
The core gameplay revolves around a battle between ships, with the player controlling their own ship and facing off against two enemy types. 

# Key Features
Two Types of Firing Modes: The player's ship is equipped with two distinct firing modes:

Single Shot: A precise, single-projectile attack.

Triple Shot: A spread shot firing three projectiles simultaneously, covering a wider area.

# Enemy Types:
Cannon Shooter: An enemy ship that attacks the player with cannonball shots.

Kamikaze: An aggressive enemy that attempts to collide with the player's ship.

# Design Patterns and Principles:
Singleton: Ensures that classes such as the Game Manager have only one instance.

Pool System: Efficiently manages the instantiation of projectiles and enemies, reducing the overhead of object creation and destruction.

State Pattern: Manages the state of the game and the behavior of the ships, allowing for a dynamic and responsive gameplay experience.

Observer Pattern: Used for event handling, ensuring a clean and efficient communication between different game components.

SOLID Principles: Throughout the development, these principles were adhered to, ensuring a robust, maintainable, and scalable codebase.

# Development Context
This project was undertaken as a challenge to not only demonstrate my technical skills in game development but also to showcase my ability to deliver a functional and engaging product within a very tight deadline. 

The choice of design patterns and architectural decisions were made to balance between code quality, performance, and the time constraints of the project.
